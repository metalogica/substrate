## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-03

### Added

- `/substrate:adopt` — install substrate's stack-agnostic docs/doctrine/gate kernel onto an existing repo of any language/stack, **without** scaffolding an opinionated framework. Ships `references/docs-core/` (canonical `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` symlink, the enforced doctrine manifest + zero-dep `doctrine-lint.sh`, the `agents` meta-doctrine + `agents-parallel-execution` doctrine, the SDD protocol, a pre-commit hook + CI workflow) and wires `substrate.yaml` to the repo's own compile/test/lint gate. The symmetric opposite of `/substrate:migrate`; leaves `doctrine-lint` green. Bumps the user-facing skill surface to ten.
- `/substrate:diagnose <error-context>` — targeted bug-fix loop. Takes a known error (message + optional file:line / timestamp / repro steps), matches it to the relevant doctrine via a path-layer + manifest-trigger + symbol-search composite scored 0–9, presents ranked hypotheses with cited doctrine rules, implements the chosen fix, then verifies BOTH the green gate (`compile`/`lint`/`test`) AND that the original error no longer reproduces. Loops on failure with accumulated context; escalates to `/substrate:architect-spec` when the fix crosses 3+ layers or needs new abstractions.

### Changed

- `/substrate:synthesize-session` — Option A: the per-feature synthesis report (`docs/tasks/completed/<feature>/synthesis-<date>.md`) is no longer written. The §1 session narrative and §7 Pareto cut now live in the body of the final `chore(<feature>): synthesis complete` commit — git is the audit log. Resumability + idempotency move to `.substrate/synthesis-state.json` (per-feature `status`, `completed-steps:`, `context:`, `narrative-commit:`). §5 parked open-design-questions are now filed as tracker beads with `type: open-question`, `status: parked` (so they show up in the queue without being pulled into the DAG as actionable work). The two append-only aggregate ledgers — `docs/synthesis-index.md` and `docs/cross-repo-followups.md` — remain as the cross-session dedup history and cross-repo decision-maker queue respectively. Legacy `synthesis-*.md` reports from prior runs are recognised as already-synthesized markers without migration.

### Fixed

- `/substrate:architect-spec` — orchestration now runs at skill level (depth 0). The previous design routed work through an `architect-spec` *subagent* (depth 1) that was supposed to dispatch `doctrine-architect` children (depth 2), but the Claude Code harness depth-cap forbids depth-2 spawn — so the fan-out silently degraded to single-context self-loading on every invocation, losing the parallel-architect cross-check. The skill now absorbs the full workflow (Q&A → parallel dispatch → mediation → composition → write), mirroring how `/substrate:migrate` already operates.
- `/substrate:synthesize-session` — global `tbd` binaries (e.g. `pnpm add -g tbd`) are now detected via `command -v tbd`, not just `npx --no-install`. When tracker is `tbd`, beads (Step 9) and doctrine amendments (Step 5) write to the tracker via ephemeral `mktemp` tempfiles + unlink; zero markdown queue artifacts land under `docs/tasks/ongoing/**`. The synthesis report at `docs/tasks/completed/<feature>/synthesis-<date>.md` is the only sanctioned `.md` write under `tbd`.

### Removed

- `agents/architect-spec.md` — orchestrator subagent deleted; its workflow lives in `skills/architect-spec/SKILL.md`.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-21

Schema conformance fixes for first install. `v0.2.0` failed to install from the marketplace due to two manifest schema violations; this release fixes both. No functional changes to skills, agents, or templates.

### Fixed

- `marketplace.json` — `plugins[0].source` changed from `"."` to `"./"`. Relative paths must start with `./` per the Claude Code marketplace schema.
- `plugin.json` — `repository` changed from an npm-style `{type, url}` object to a plain URL string. The Claude Code plugin schema expects a string, not an object.
- `plugin.json` — removed `bugs` field (not in the documented plugin schema).

### Added

- `marketplace.json` — `metadata.description` and `metadata.version` to satisfy the marketplace validator's warning.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-21

First public release. Distributed via the `metalogica` plugin marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add metalogica/substrate
/plugin install substrate@metalogica
```

### Skills

- `/substrate:init` — scaffold a new project in an empty directory (stage 1).
- `/substrate:migrate` — migrate a Gemini AI Studio prototype into the kernel (stage 2).
- `/substrate:deploy` — Clerk + Vercel + first live deploy (stage 3).
- `/substrate:architect-spec <brief>` — SDD orchestrator that produces gated multi-phase specs.
- `/substrate:execute <spec>` — executes a spec phase-by-phase with verification gates.
- `/substrate:quick-spec` — lightweight single-feature iteration loop.

### Agents

- `domain-architect`, `backend-architect`, `frontend-architect` — per-layer specialists spawned in parallel by orchestrator skills.
- `architect-spec` — SDD orchestrator that composes layer-specialist outputs into a spec.

### References (bundled)

- `doctrines/` — domain / backend / frontend architectural doctrines, copied into every scaffolded project as `docs/doctrine/`.
- `sdd-protocol/` — brief format, execution format, spec template, copied into every scaffolded project as `docs/protocol/sdd/`.
- `templates/` — the ready-to-copy project kernel.
- `example/` — golden-reference finished project for quality comparison.

### Metadata

- Added `LICENSE` (MIT).
- Added `homepage` and `repository` fields to `plugin.json`.
- Added `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` for marketplace-style install.
